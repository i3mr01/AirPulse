AirPulse turns any phone into a buttery-smooth media remote and trackpad. Scan the QR code, punch in the PIN, and your desktop instantly feels futuristic.

---

## 🌈 Vibes
- **Zero-fuss pairing** — launch the desktop app and a fresh PIN + QR appear right away.
- **Live media tiles** — album art, titles, and playback state glow in real time.
- **Gesture trackpad** — swipe, tap, and click from the couch like it’s built in.
- **Tray-first design** — lives quietly until you need it, complete with auto-start.

---

## 🚀 Getting Rolling
1. **Install & launch** `AirPulse.exe`.
2. Hit the same Wi‑Fi as your PC, open the QR on your phone, or visit the URL shown.
3. Enter the six-digit PIN (or let the QR fill it for you) and vibe out.

Need to switch adapters? Tap the IP inside the app and it cycles through every network it finds.

 ## ⚙️ Under the hood
 - Built on **.NET 8 + WPF** so it feels native on Windows.
 - Embedded **ASP.NET Core + SignalR** server powers the live pairing magic.
 - The mobile UI is a slick **Tailwind** single page living in `wwwroot`.
